<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is my very first Python program, having worked with Python for almost two weeks. 
The project is a program that simulates a bank transaction terminal.
Nothing complex, just a few lists of options.
July 2025.

<!-- Characteristics -->
## Characteristics
This code is executed using main.py. Use the text file as a database (fakebank_db.txt) that is created automatically if not found. You can check your balance, make a deposit, display all transactions, or only a specific transaction list based on who logged in.

To log in need to use an account number 5 digits long and a ping number 4 digits long. You can also create your own account.
